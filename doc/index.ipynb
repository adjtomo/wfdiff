If you are well versed in Python, then the installation should not prove an issue, otherwise, please follow the advice here and download the [Anaconda Python distribution](http://continuum.io/downloads) for your system. In case you don't know which version to choose, choose Python 3.4. `wfdiff` nonetheless also works with Python 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4.\n",
